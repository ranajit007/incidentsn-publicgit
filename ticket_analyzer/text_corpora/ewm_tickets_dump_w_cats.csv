It could be possible that it was a timing issue between the carrier delivering this load verses SAP generating an inbound delivery so it's visible in eWM. Perhaps the carrier attempted to deliver prior to SAP generating the inbound delivery.

Based on the successful test results in REG & PPD (including validation by RBS AMS MFG, RBS AMS QM) CRs have been progressed to PROD in May IA.  Development details: As per requirement, the development has been made to overwrite RFC* user by initiator ID from source box to destination box, i.e. Someone (SAP user ID UWCRSTAA) has executed Inbound delivery in ECC ? Case 1: Before development the same delivery will replicate in EWM by RFC* SAP ID Case2: After this development same delivery will replicate in EWM by SAP user id UWCRSTAA. And same concept will continue (mentioned in case2) from EWM to ECC.  Assumption or prerequisite: It was assumed for this development that ECC SAP user will be available in EWM box and vice versa.  Why this issue in PROD: The PROD issue is not because of PPD testing or test validation or +ve & -ve steps and scenario. Issue is because of assumption. In brief, the user JOBRUN_NP was created IBD # in ECC which is not present (user JOBRUN_NP) in EWM box. As the development is forcing to replicate IBD # to EWM box with same user, hence failing.  IA Fix: Code has been modified (ECC- 8000324616 & EWM- 8000324598) to check user details before changing RFC* ID.  Assumption after IA fix: The Dialog user (real user) should be available in both box ECC & EWM.   ",0,Outbound__Delivery_Creation,Incorrect User ID

Now users are saying that since this morning, they noticed when the loaders are SDP, the HUs are being scanned to D03 and not the door the TU is in. When the dock tries to post an order that was SDP they receive an error, even though the load is complete. The dock has to move all HUs that were SDP to the original door that the TU was in to post the order. This issue started occurring this morning.   Example TU is T803632912 see attached picture of the error. The TU was docked at door 61 but you see all the loading tasks (WPT Z212) had destination bin D03. Per the fix mentioned above it was supposed to prevent the picked HUs using SDP from ending up in the WRITEON bin or other 9010 storage type bins, and instead load the HUs straight to the TU.

Please provide description of the issue or request as well as any Analysis already performed.: : There has been issues for many shipments wich have incorrect picks for 12361574  The latest is  UC45643345   The WTs are consistently picking pallets with batches beginning with 9 (last year batches)and then not allowing the loaders to pick from the bins that the WTs direct them to. The only way the wave releases to pallets with batches beginning with zero is if we block all of the 9 batch bins. When the loaders try to pick the 9 batches it tells them the pallets are expired. These are the only batches we have left in inventory and none of them expire before 3/2022.  If you see the WT for current shipmen UC45643345   one of the bin is N125 which has last year batches. It has 9 WT. But only 4 pallets in the bin which satisfy the batch requirement in the delivery which is > 05/20/2022. All other batches expire 04/30/2022 in the bin. So what is the point in creating 9 WT frm that bin and when the loader goes it will send him back.   This has happened multiple times and we have had to block the ?offending? bin and have the operator pull from a different bin. But need to know why is this happening as the operators are being sent to these bins by the system only to be told the pallets are not good. ? How should the requestor be contacted?: Email ?

Yard Management not updating, dock doors are getting jammed with TU's for STO's and is effecting loading.picking and shipping. This needs to be resolved ASAP.  Thanks, Nikitha K ?

They are still tied to the PDI document, but also loaded to the TU.  Now can't repack the product back onto the PDI, move the stock or pick them to the delivery either.   376130347613879224 376130347613879187  UPDATE: Got more news from the FE at Mecosta, he said that what they are doing is instead of going to the suggested Whse bin when putaway from production, they are then hitting the ""Change Bin"" button, and scanning to a door directly as if to line load, even though the system is not proposing line load. They claim they get no error and it just accepts the door when they scan it, and then this result occurs.  For this ticket I just want the two HUs fixed so we can repack them onto the HUs and then pick them to the load. But ultimately what I want is another PBR or PBI ticket to figure out two things: 1. Why is it causing these HU#s to be stripped off the product?  2. Why then is the stock still tied to the PDI document from the MFG order?   At the very least, I would expect that when they do this series of steps, that the HU just moves to the Door bin.  But does NOT tie to the PDO document, and does not get the HU# stripped.    I'm fine if it remains tied to the PDI document, and then they will just have to learn that what they did was wrong. and they will have to move to the HU to a warehouse bin to remove association to the PDI document, then pick it to the intended load from that bin if they want to. Soon enough they'll learn their mistakes, but for now it's completely stopping us the way it's breaking now and not allowing us to do anything with the stock.
